# ROOBEER
ROOBEER language. Includes python script to run .roobeer files as well as documentation.

ROOBEER was designed to emulate the nonsense rambling of a man obsessed with ROOBEER, whilst still being a functional coding language.
ROOBEER is an interpreted langauge run line-by-line.

It is hard to code in ROOBEER and make anything useful.

So, my challenge is...
